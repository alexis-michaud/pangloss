# pangloss
This repository hosts scripts and materials related to the Pangloss Collection. Note that the official repository of the Pangloss Collection is at https://github.com/CNRS/Pangloss and that the interface to consult the Pangloss Collection is at https://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/pangloss/.


The first script hosted in this repository is a Praat script that takes as input (i) a Praat TextGrid and (ii) the EFEO-CNRS-SOAS word list. It generates as output an XML file in the Pangloss format for word lists (\<WORDLIST\>). This script was written by MẠC Đăng Khoa as part of a digitization project funded by the Digital Scientific Library.

There are also some scripts of mine at https://github.com/alexis-michaud/na/tree/master/SCRIPTS
